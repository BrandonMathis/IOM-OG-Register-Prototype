#Changelog

## 0.9.1

* Fixed issue where response status code was not read from raw (curl -is) responses

## 0.9.0
  
* Matching requests against provided block (by Sergio Gil)

		stub_request(:post, "www.example.com").with { |request| request.body == "abc" }.to_return(:body => "def")
		RestClient.post('www.example.com', 'abc')    # ===> "def\n"
		request(:post, "www.example.com").with { |req| req.body == "abc" }.should have_been_made	
		#or 
		assert_requested(:post, "www.example.com") { |req| req.body == "abc" }

* Matching request body against regular expressions

		stub_request(:post, "www.example.com").with(:body => /^.*world$/).to_return(:body => "abc")
		RestClient.post('www.example.com', 'hello world')    # ===> "abc\n"
	
* Matching request headers against regular expressions

		stub_request(:post, "www.example.com").with(:headers => {"Content-Type" => /image\/.+/}).to_return(:body => "abc")
		RestClient.post('www.example.com', '', {'Content-Type' => 'image/png'})    # ===> "abc\n"

* Replaying raw responses recorded with `curl -is`

		`curl -is www.example.com > /tmp/example_curl_-is_output.txt`
		raw_response_file = File.new("/tmp/example_curl_-is_output.txt")
	
	from file
	
		stub_request(:get, "www.example.com").to_return(raw_response_file)

	or string
	
		stub_request(:get, "www.example.com").to_return(raw_response_file.read)

* Multiple responses for repeated requests

		stub_request(:get, "www.example.com").to_return({:body => "abc"}, {:body => "def"})
		Net::HTTP.get('www.example.com', '/')    # ===> "abc\n"
		Net::HTTP.get('www.example.com', '/')    # ===> "def\n"

* Multiple responses using chained `to_return()` or `to_raise()` declarations

		stub_request(:get, "www.example.com").
			to_return({:body => "abc"}).then.  #then() just is a syntactic sugar
			to_return({:body => "def"}).then.
			to_raise(MyException)
		Net::HTTP.get('www.example.com', '/')    # ===> "abc\n"
		Net::HTTP.get('www.example.com', '/')    # ===> "def\n"
		Net::HTTP.get('www.example.com', '/')    # ===> MyException raised
	
* Specifying number of times given response should be returned

		stub_request(:get, "www.example.com").
			to_return({:body => "abc"}).times(2).then.
			to_return({:body => "def"})
	
		Net::HTTP.get('www.example.com', '/')    # ===> "abc\n"
		Net::HTTP.get('www.example.com', '/')    # ===> "abc\n"
		Net::HTTP.get('www.example.com', '/')    # ===> "def\n"
	
* Added support for `Net::HTTP::Post#body_stream`

	This fixes compatibility with new versions of RestClient
	
* WebMock doesn't suppress default request headers added by http clients anymore.

	i.e. Net::HTTP adds `'Accept'=>'*/*'` to all requests by default
	
	
	
## 0.8.2
  
  * Fixed issue where WebMock was not closing IO object passed as response body after reading it.
  * Ruby 1.9.2 compat: Use `File#expand_path` for require path because "." is not be included in LOAD_PATH since Ruby 1.9.2


## 0.8.1
  
  * Fixed HTTPClient adapter compatibility with Ruby 1.8.6 (reported by Piotr Usewicz)
  * Net:HTTP adapter now handles request body assigned as Net::HTTP::Post#body attribute (fixed by Mack Earnhardt)
  * Fixed issue where requests were not matching stubs with Accept header set.(reported by Piotr Usewicz)
  * Fixed compatibility with Ruby 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and JRuby 1.3.1 (reported by Diego E. “Flameeyes” Pettenò)
  * Fixed issue with response body declared as IO object and multiple requests (reported by Niels Meersschaert)
  * Fixed "undefined method `assertion_failure'" error (reported by Nick Plante)


## 0.8.0

  * Support for HTTPClient (sync and async requests)
  * Support for dynamic responses. Response body and headers can be now declared as lambda. 
	(Thanks to Ivan Vega ( @ivanyv ) for suggesting this feature)
  * Support for stubbing and expecting requests with empty body
  * Executing non-stubbed request leads to failed expectation instead of error


### Bug fixes

  * Basic authentication now works correctly
  * Fixed problem where WebMock didn't call a block with the response when block was provided
  * Fixed problem where uris with single slash were not matching uris without path provided


## 0.7.3

  * Clarified documentation
  * Fixed some issues with loading of Webmock classes
  * Test::Unit and RSpec adapters have to be required separately


## 0.7.2

  * Added support for matching escaped and non escaped URLs
