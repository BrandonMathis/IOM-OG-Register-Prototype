This is an open source reference implementation of the MIMOSA Active Registry

How to start this app
==================================================================================
cd into directory containing app
boot sinatra postback server
	sinatra lib/postback_server.rb
start server
	script/server
app will be at http://localhost:3000


Code Details
==================================================================================
The following contains a rewrite of the mimosa active registry in order
    to support the inporting of 3.3 format CCOM XML. Most of these changes
    consist of adding an "xml_element => "New Name" to declared mongo 'documents.'
    Many of these changes may not be best practice but this is my first
    attempt at tackling ruby.
    
    The following things are important to note
        -This active registry supports installing assets onto a segment but will
         not uninstall those assets properly.
        -A HTTP postback command causes some trouble on personal machines and needs
		 to be commented out if you want to run via mongrel 
        -Test do not pass in this commit. This is beta at best.
